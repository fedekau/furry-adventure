This is a prototype for a school project, the idea was to build something cool with an unknow technology
for the people involved.

Using C# and Xamarin we developed this fully functional prototype that send broadcast messages to all
devices running the app in the same network.

It's been tested in Android 4.0 and 5.0 using Galaxy S3, S4 and S5 devices.
